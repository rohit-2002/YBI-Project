# Machine Learning Projects: Bitcoin Price Prediction & Cement Compressive Strength Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains two machine learning projects that utilize regression and classification techniques to predict key outcomes in real-world scenarios:

### 1. **Bitcoin Price Prediction**

#### Project Description:
The Bitcoin Price Prediction project leverages historical Bitcoin data to predict the closing price of Bitcoin based on various market-related features. The dataset includes factors like opening price, highest price, lowest price, transactions, mining difficulty, and more. The goal is to train a machine learning model to forecast future prices based on these features.

#### Key Features:
- Historical Bitcoin prices (open, close, high, low)
- Blockchain transaction metrics (e.g., transaction count, block size)
- Mining metrics (e.g., difficulty, hashrate)
- External factors like Google Trends and Twitter activity

#### Objective:
To predict the Bitcoin closing price using machine learning algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) based on historical data.

#### Use Cases:
- Cryptocurrency market analysis
- Investment strategy development
- Trading bots and algorithmic trading systems

### 2. **Cement Compressive Strength Prediction**

#### Project Description:
The Cement Compressive Strength Prediction project focuses on predicting the compressive strength of concrete based on the quantities of various materials used in the mixture, such as cement, water, aggregates, and others. This project helps in understanding how different variables affect concrete quality, which is critical for construction and civil engineering applications.

#### Key Features:
- Mixture components (cement, water, aggregates, etc.)
- Age of concrete mixture
- Concrete compressive strength (target variable)

#### Objective:
To predict the compressive strength of concrete based on material composition and age, using regression models like Linear Regression.

#### Use Cases:
- Civil engineering and construction industry
- Material optimization for concrete mixtures
- Predictive maintenance in construction projects
